One morning, at the middle of hills, Terrorists attacked boondocks of a peaceful village.
Why did they do that ?? Nobody knows (not even me), but what is sure is that they gonna try to explode either the fountain or the restaurant.
Of course, Counter-Terrorists are here to stop them !!



Terrorists : 
Explode either the fountain or the restaurant

Counter-Terrorists :
